# Family History

Software for the processing of geneological information.


## Motivation

There are two motivations for this work:

1. An interest in geneology.
2. A desire to develop scala and functional programming skills.

I combine these two interests in the project by creating a data type framework and associated
functions for manipulating the data found within family trees, geneological research and family history.
If I persist, I may end up creating a "better mouse trap" for this kind of geneology database.  At the
very least, this project provides a goal and motivation to learn and practice.
